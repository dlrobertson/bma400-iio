	  Say Y here if you want to build a driver for the Bosch BMA400
	  triaxial acceleration sensor.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called bma400_core and you will also get
	  bma400_i2c if I2C is enabled and bma400_spi if SPI is
	  enabled.

config BMA400_I2C

	depends on BMA400

config BMA400_SPI
